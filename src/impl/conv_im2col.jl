    conv_im2col!(y, x, w, cdims, col=similar(x); alpha=1, beta=0)

Perform a convolution using im2col and GEMM, store the result in `y`.  The  kwargs
`alpha` and `beta` control accumulation behavior; internally this operation is
implemented as a matrix multiply that boils down to `y = alpha * x * w + beta * y`, thus
by setting `beta` to a non-zero value, multiple results can be accumulated into `y`, or
by setting `alpha` to a non-unitary value, various gain factors can be applied.

Note for the particularly performance-minded, you can provide a pre-allocated `col`,
which should eliminate any need for large allocations within this method.
